Here are 5 basic theme layouts to choose from. All that these reflect is places the menu, content, and widgets are placed. Not only that, but the sizing, shape, and relation to each other can all be changed to anything which suits your needs. The color schemes I choose are all complimentary and visually appealing – that said, color can easily be changed in any location without any difficulty. Here is a fun and useful color picking tool I personally use (<a href="http://color.hailpixel.com/">http://color.hailpixel.com/</a>). Google has provided a fantastic web font database (<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">http://www.google.com/webfonts</a>) which I utilize to it’s full potential. Feel free to give any suggestions of fonts you may find appealing.
